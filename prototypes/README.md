Unsure how to do this project just yet.
Thus will be writing small prototypes for different calculator parts (of logic).
Which can hopefully be united into a full blown calculator afterwards.

### Prototype functions
    1. a function "ignoreMultiple", that takes user string and puts out a modified string (several 0000 get ignored)
    2. an html file, where user can enter a string of numbers via buttons and your program displays it
    4. a function "splitExpression", that splits a string into an array of numbers and operators
    5. parse a string as though it's a stack with pop and push methods (Reverse Polish Notation style + Shunting Yard Algorithm)
    6. edge case for when there aren't enough operands/operators
    7.  a way to deal with very long numbers(integers)
